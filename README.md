I am just revisiting this amazing course from Stephen Grider:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start-server`

Runs the json-server for local development.\
The json-server is listing on port `3005`.\
See [db.json](./db.json) and [api.http](./api.http) for resources and endpoints.\

**! important:** use [db.json.template](./db.json.template) to create the inital `db.json` file - which is included within the `.gitignore`.
